# Spring 2023 Update
This repository was built in service of APIs and helping various integrators understand how to use our APIs, sample code that we might hand out.  We are not actively maintaining this at this time, as most lenders or other integrators get their support from Snapdocs in non-sample-code manners.

# The ACME Lender

This repository has the example code to help our customers to test and integrate with the Snapdocs APIs.

## Project Structure

We have example code in below programming languages

* Python
* Node.js
* Java
* Go
* C#

## Example Programs

1. To confirm the oauth credentials
2. a simple AWS Lambda function to listen to Snapdocs events, and download the scanback documents.
3. To create closings, and manage subscriptions

## Configuration

All the programs (regardless programming languages) are expecting configuration items from environment variables.

## Environment Variables
We use .env to manage environment variables since it is widely supported.

### Non-Secrets
For local testing, you can create a file ".env" as below

````
SNAPDOCS_TOKEN_URL=https://auth.cs-demo0.snpd.io/oauth/token
SNAPDOCS_API_URL=https://api.cs-demo0.snpd.io/api/v1
SNAPDOCS_API_CLIENT_ID=...
SNAPDOCS_API_CLIENT_SECRET=...
SNAPDOCS_API_SCOPE=...
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
````
The SNAPDOCS_API_CLIENT_ID and SNAPDOCS_API_CLIENT_SECRET must be valid and match the testing hosts.
The scope can have multiple scopes separated by space.

### Secrets

If you want to test the webhook with example AWS Lambda and API Gateway , the oauth client id and secret should be deployed through AWS Secret Manager.

Go to AWS Console, select the "Secret Manager" service, add a new secret (check the "Other type of secret")
Add two rows of key-value pairs.
````
key:SNAPDOCS_API_CLIENT_ID
value: the oauth client id
````
and
````
key: SNAPDOCS_API_CLIENT_SECRET
value: the oauth client secret
````
Use the "DefaultEncryptionKey"

On the next screen, enter the secret name "dev/example-snapdocs-event-listener/oauth", accept all the default values and store the secret.


## Webhook Service (Listener)

The webhook (a lambda behind API gateway), that  can register at Snapdocs and receive events.


## Deploy the Snapdocs event listener example (webhook service) to AWS

1. edit the .env.dev file to make sure you have the correct URLs and scope.

2. install the serverless framework https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started

````
cd [python/go/node.js/java folder]
npm install -g serverless
serverless plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements
````

3. Deploy to AWS, for example us-west-2 region, environment "dev", assuming you have the AWS profile set up in your ~/.aws/credentials file and have the permissions to create AWS stacks.

````
serverless deploy --stage dev --region us-west-2 --verbose --aws-profile [the AWS profile name that you use]
````

you should see something like below in the output
````
âœ” Service deployed to stack example-snapdocs-event-listener-dev (131s)

endpoint: POST - https://....execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/listen/snapdocs
functions:
  snapdocs-event-listener: example-snapdocs-event-listener-dev-snapdocs-event-listener (5.8 MB)

Stack Outputs:
  SnapdocsDasheventDashlistenerLambdaFunctionQualifiedArn: ...
  ServiceEndpoint: https://....execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev
  ServerlessDeploymentBucketName: ...

````

The "https://....execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/listen/snapdocs" is the webhook url that you will use
later to register at Snapdocs

To do a quick test of the webhook service

````
curl --location --request POST 'https://.....execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/listen/snapdocs' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{

      }
    ]
  }
}'
